# PH-B10 Milestone 05: Assignment 05 Solution

This was the assignment for the 5th milestone of the 10th batch of the Web Development course offered by Programming Hero. After HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS and JS basic, the JS DOM was taught in this milestone, and this Donation campaign page was created using all of these. This project is done with a focus on the DOM in JavaScript. There are some basic level, interesting implementations of the DOM here. Additionally, to organize the code, some common reusable functions have been used by following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

The page has been made responsive for all the breakpoints mentioned in Tailwind CSS, meaning it is responsive for all devices.

This will remain just as an assignment, and there are no plans to update it.
